title: Terraform Cloud Audit Log Destination Removed
id: d4e5f6a7-b8c9-4d0e-1f2a-3b4c5d6e7f80
status: test
description: |
    Detects when an audit log streaming destination is removed from a Terraform Cloud
    organization. Removing audit log destinations prevents security teams from monitoring
    infrastructure changes and may indicate an attacker attempting to cover their tracks.
    This corresponds to HTH Terraform Cloud control hth-terraform-cloud-5.01-audit-logging (section 5.1, L1).
