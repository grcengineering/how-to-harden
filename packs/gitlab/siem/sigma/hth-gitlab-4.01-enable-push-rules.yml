title: GitLab Push Rules Modified or Disabled
id: d8e6f234-5c1a-4b97-a2f0-c3d9e71b58a6
status: test
description: |
    Detects creation, modification, or deletion of push rules on a project. Push rules
    enforce secret prevention and commit signing requirements. Disabling or weakening
    push rules may indicate an attacker preparing to push malicious code or secrets
    into a repository without detection.
    This corresponds to HTH GitLab control hth-gitlab-4.01-enable-push-rules (section 4.1, L1).
