title: MongoDB Atlas Database Auditing Disabled
id: b4f2d9e3-7a16-4c8f-a521-9d6b0e3f8c47
status: test
description: |
    Detects when database auditing is disabled on a MongoDB Atlas project. Disabling
    auditing removes visibility into authentication, authorization, and DDL events,
    which is a prerequisite for covering tracks after unauthorized access. Auditing
    should never be disabled in production environments.
    This corresponds to HTH MongoDB Atlas control hth-mongodb-atlas-4.01-enable-database-auditing (section 4.1, L1).
