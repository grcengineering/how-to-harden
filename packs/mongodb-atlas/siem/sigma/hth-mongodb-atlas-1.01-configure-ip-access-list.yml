title: MongoDB Atlas Open IP Access List Entry (0.0.0.0/0) Added
id: a7e3c8f1-2d94-4b1e-9f06-3c8a5d7e2b10
status: test
description: |
    Detects when 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 is added to a MongoDB Atlas project IP access
    list, exposing databases to the entire internet. This is the most critical Atlas
    misconfiguration and must be remediated immediately. Legitimate use is extremely
    rare and should require documented approval.
    This corresponds to HTH MongoDB Atlas control hth-mongodb-atlas-1.01-configure-ip-access-list (section 1.1, L1).
