title: Vault Audit Device Disabled
id: d2e8b4a6-1f73-5c9d-a45e-7b0d9c2f6e1a
status: test
description: |
    Detects when a Vault audit device is disabled via the sys/audit API endpoint.
    Disabling audit logging removes visibility into Vault operations and is a
    critical indicator of defense evasion. All audit device removals should be
    investigated immediately and require change management approval.
    This corresponds to HTH HashiCorp Vault control hth-hashicorp-vault-4.01-enable-comprehensive-audit-logging (section 4.1, L1).
