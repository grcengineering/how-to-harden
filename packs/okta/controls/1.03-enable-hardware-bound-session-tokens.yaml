  Configure Okta to bind session tokens to specific devices using device trust and Okta
  FastPass, preventing session token theft and replay attacks. The October 2023 breach
  exploited stolen session cookies from HAR files, making hardware-bound sessions a
  critical defense against credential theft via support channels.
