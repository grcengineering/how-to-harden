description: >
  Harden admin sessions with ASN binding, IP binding, and Protected Actions. These
  controls prevent session hijacking by invalidating admin sessions when network
  characteristics change, and require step-up authentication before critical operations
  like creating Identity Providers or resetting MFA factors. Post-breach product
  enhancement designed to prevent October 2023-style session replay attacks.
