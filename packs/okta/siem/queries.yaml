# HTH Okta Code Pack — SIEM Detection Queries
# https://howtoharden.com/guides/okta/
#
# DEPRECATED: This file has been replaced by individual Sigma rules
# in the sigma/ directory. Sigma is the universal, translatable SIEM
# detection meta-language supported by all major SIEM platforms.
#
# Migration:
#   - All 24 queries have been converted to Sigma v2 format
#   - Rules are in: packs/okta/siem/sigma/hth_okta_*.yml
#   - Use sigma-cli or pySigma to convert to your SIEM's native format:
#       sigma convert -t splunk sigma/
#       sigma convert -t elastic_lucene sigma/
#       sigma convert -t microsoft365defender sigma/
#
# Guide version: 0.3.0
# Last updated: 2026-02-13
# Sigma migration date: 2026-02-13

# This file is retained for reference only. Do not add new queries here.
# All new detection rules should be created as Sigma rules in sigma/.
