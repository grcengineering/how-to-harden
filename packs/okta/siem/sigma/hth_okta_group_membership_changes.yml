description: |
    Monitors group membership additions and removals, especially for privileged groups
    such as admin groups and security groups. Unauthorized group membership changes can
    grant access to applications and admin roles, enabling privilege escalation.
    This corresponds to HTH Okta control okta-group-membership-changes (section 7.4, L2).
