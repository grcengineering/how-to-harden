title: Okta Admin Role Created - Custom Role Lifecycle Event
id: 5f1c8b34-2d7e-4a96-b9f3-c64a1e8d7b25
status: test
description: |
    Monitors creation of new admin roles and role assignments. Custom roles with excessive
    permissions or unexpected role grants may indicate privilege escalation attempts.
    Role creation should be rare and require documented justification through change
    management.
    This corresponds to HTH Okta control okta-admin-role-lifecycle (section 7.4, L2).
