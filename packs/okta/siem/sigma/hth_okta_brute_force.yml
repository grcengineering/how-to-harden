title: Okta Brute Force or Password Spray - Repeated Authentication Failures
id: b8c4d2e5-9f3a-4b07-c6e4-a2f8b0d17c53
status: test
description: |
    Detects failed authentication attempts that may indicate brute force or password spray
    attacks. Repeated failures against a single account suggest brute force; failures across
    many accounts from one IP suggest password spray. Both are high-severity credential
    access techniques.
    Note: Threshold-based alerting (>10 failures per user within 5 minutes) must be
    configured at the SIEM level using aggregation rules over actor.alternateId and the
    published timestamp.
    This corresponds to HTH Okta control okta-brute-force (section 5.1, L1).
