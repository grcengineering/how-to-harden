title: Okta Authenticator Enrolled or Password Changed
id: ec86b60e-1610-5621-987a-922d96cf71f7
status: test
description: |
    Detects authenticator enrollment, activation, and password changes. Attackers
    who gain temporary access immediately register their own MFA factors to
    maintain persistence. Correlate with suspicious activity reports and recent
    sign-in anomalies. High volume during onboarding is expected; focus on
    out-of-band enrollments.
    This corresponds to HTH Okta control hth-okta-1.11-enable-security-notifications (section 1.11, L1).
