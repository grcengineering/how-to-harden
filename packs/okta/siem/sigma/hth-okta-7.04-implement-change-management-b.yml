id: 4d9a2e56-3c81-4f07-b6d2-f15e8a7c9d43
status: test
description: |
    Monitors application creation and modification events to detect unauthorized
    integrations. New applications may introduce OAuth scopes, SCIM provisioning, or
    federation trust that expand the attack surface. All application changes should be
    correlated with approved change requests.
    This corresponds to HTH Okta control hth-okta-7.04-implement-change-management (section 7.4, L2).
