title: Okta Behavior Detection Rule Triggered - Anomalous User Activity
id: e1f7a5b8-2c6d-4e30-f9b7-d5c1e3a40f86
status: test
description: |
    Detects when Okta behavior detection rules fire, including new device, new location,
    new IP, velocity anomalies (impossible travel), and IP reputation signals. Okta
    evaluates these behavioral signals on every authentication and triggers this event
    when anomalous patterns are identified. These detections provide early warning of
    account compromise or unauthorized access attempts.
    This corresponds to HTH Okta control hth-okta-5.04-behavior-detection (section 5.4, L2).
