title: Okta Network Zone Created or Modified
id: 7c5b3f18-9d4a-4e62-a8c1-b26d4f0e5a92
status: test
description: |
    Monitors creation and modification of network zones. An attacker with admin access
    could add their own IP ranges to trusted zones, bypassing IP-based access controls
    and network restriction policies. Network zone changes should be rare and tightly
    audited.
    This corresponds to HTH Okta control hth-okta-7.04-implement-change-management (section 7.4, L2).
