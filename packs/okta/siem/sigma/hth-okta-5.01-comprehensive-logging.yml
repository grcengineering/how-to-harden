title: Okta Admin Role Assignment or Modification - Privilege Escalation Detection
id: c9d5e3f6-0a4b-4c18-d7f5-b3a9c1e28d64
status: test
description: |
    Detects changes to admin role assignments including role grants, revocations, creation,
    and deletion. Privilege escalation via unauthorized role changes is a key post-compromise
    technique. An attacker with sufficient access can elevate privileges by assigning
    Super Admin or Org Admin roles to compromised accounts.
    This corresponds to HTH Okta control hth-okta-5.01-comprehensive-logging (section 5.1, L1).
