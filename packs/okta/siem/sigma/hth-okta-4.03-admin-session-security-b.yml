title: Okta Protected Actions Step-Up Authentication Events
id: 7c4f2d68-1a5e-4b93-8e7d-a6b9c0f13d45
status: test
description: |
    Monitors Protected Actions step-up authentication events. These fire when admins
    perform critical operations that require re-authentication such as IdP changes,
    MFA resets, and policy modifications. Frequent challenges or failures may indicate
    an attacker attempting privileged operations with a compromised admin session.
    This corresponds to HTH Okta control hth-okta-4.03-admin-session-security (section 4.3, L1).
