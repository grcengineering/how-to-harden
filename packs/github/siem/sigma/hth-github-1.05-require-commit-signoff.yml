title: GitHub Organization Default Repository Permission Changed (Commit Signoff)
id: e5f6a7b8-c9d0-4e1f-2a3b-4c5d6e7f8091
status: test
description: |
    Detects when the default repository permission is updated, which includes changes
    to commit signoff requirements. Disabling commit signoff removes developer
    accountability for contributed code and weakens audit trails.
    This corresponds to HTH GitHub control hth-github-1.05-require-commit-signoff (section 1.5, L2).
