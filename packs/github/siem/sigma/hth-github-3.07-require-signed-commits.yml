title: GitHub Branch Protection Signed Commits Requirement Changed
id: e7f80910-2132-4435-4657-687980910213
status: test
description: |
    Detects when a branch protection rule is updated that may change the signed
    commits requirement. Disabling required commit signing allows unverified commits
    to be merged, weakening code provenance and integrity guarantees.
    This corresponds to HTH GitHub control hth-github-3.07-require-signed-commits (section 3.7, L2).
