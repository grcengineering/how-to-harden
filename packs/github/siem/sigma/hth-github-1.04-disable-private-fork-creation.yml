id: d4e5f6a7-b8c9-4d0e-1f2a-3b4c5d6e7f80
status: test
description: |
    Detects when the member repository forking permission is changed for a GitHub
    organization. Enabling private forks can allow members to copy repository contents
    outside organizational controls, risking data exfiltration.
    This corresponds to HTH GitHub control hth-github-1.04-disable-private-fork-creation (section 1.4, L2).
