id: a1b2c3d4-e5f6-4a7b-8c9d-0e1f2a3b4c5d
status: test
description: |
    Detects when the two-factor authentication requirement is disabled for a GitHub
    organization. Disabling 2FA removes a critical authentication safeguard and exposes
    all organization members to credential-based attacks.
    This corresponds to HTH GitHub control hth-github-1.01-enforce-2fa-for-org-members (section 1.1, L1).
