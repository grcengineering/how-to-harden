    Detects when vulnerability alerts are disabled on a GitHub repository. Vulnerability
    alerts notify maintainers of known security issues in dependencies. Disabling these
    alerts leaves the repository blind to known exploitable vulnerabilities.
    This corresponds to HTH GitHub control hth-github-4.01-enable-vulnerability-alerts (section 4.1, L1).
