    Detects when a Dependabot vulnerability alert is dismissed. Tracking alert
    dismissals supports SLA compliance monitoring and ensures vulnerabilities are
    addressed rather than silently suppressed without remediation.
    This corresponds to HTH GitHub control hth-github-4.02-review-open-dependabot-alerts (section 4.2, L1).
