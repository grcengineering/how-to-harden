    Detects when a branch protection rule is removed from a repository. Branch
    protection enforces code review, status checks, and merge restrictions. Removing
    these rules allows unreviewed code to be pushed directly to protected branches.
    This corresponds to HTH GitHub control hth-github-3.01-enable-branch-protection-on-default-branch (section 3.1, L1).
