title: GitHub Actions Permissions Changed (SHA Pinning Enforcement)
id: a3b4c5d6-e7f8-4091-0213-243546576879
status: test
description: |
    Detects when GitHub Actions permissions are changed at the repository level, which
    may allow unpinned actions to execute. Actions not pinned to a specific SHA are
    vulnerable to supply chain attacks through tag or branch manipulation.
    This corresponds to HTH GitHub control hth-github-3.03-pin-actions-to-sha (section 3.3, L2).
