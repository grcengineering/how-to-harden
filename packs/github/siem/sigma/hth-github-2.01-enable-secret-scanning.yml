    Detects when secret scanning is disabled on a GitHub repository. Secret scanning
    identifies credentials and tokens accidentally committed to repositories. Disabling
    this feature removes a critical safety net against credential exposure.
    This corresponds to HTH GitHub control hth-github-2.01-enable-secret-scanning (section 2.1, L1).
