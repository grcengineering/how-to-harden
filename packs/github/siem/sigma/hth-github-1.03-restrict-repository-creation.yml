    Detects when the member repository creation permission is changed for a GitHub
    organization. Allowing unrestricted repository creation can lead to shadow IT,
    unmonitored code repositories, and policy bypass.
    This corresponds to HTH GitHub control hth-github-1.03-restrict-repository-creation (section 1.3, L1).
