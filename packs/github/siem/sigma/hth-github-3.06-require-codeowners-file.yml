    Detects when a branch protection rule is updated that may change the CODEOWNERS
    review requirement. Disabling required code owner reviews allows changes to
    critical paths without approval from designated owners.
    This corresponds to HTH GitHub control hth-github-3.06-require-codeowners-file (section 3.6, L2).
