    Detects when GitHub Actions permissions are changed at the repository level.
    Broadening Actions permissions can allow execution of untrusted or unverified
    third-party actions, introducing supply chain attack vectors.
    This corresponds to HTH GitHub control hth-github-3.02-restrict-actions-to-verified-creators (section 3.2, L1).
