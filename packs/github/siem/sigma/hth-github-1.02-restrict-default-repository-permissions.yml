title: GitHub Organization Default Repository Permission Changed
id: b2c3d4e5-f6a7-4b8c-9d0e-1f2a3b4c5d6e
status: test
description: |
    Detects when the default repository permission level is changed for a GitHub
    organization. Elevating default permissions can grant overly broad access to all
    members across all repositories, violating the principle of least privilege.
    This corresponds to HTH GitHub control hth-github-1.02-restrict-default-repository-permissions (section 1.2, L1).
