    Detects when a new webhook is created at the organization level. Webhooks send
    event data to external URLs and can be abused for data exfiltration by forwarding
    repository events, code push notifications, and secrets to attacker-controlled endpoints.
    This corresponds to HTH GitHub control hth-github-5.03-audit-org-webhooks (section 5.3, L1).
