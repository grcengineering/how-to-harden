id: d0e1f2a3-b4c5-4d6e-7f80-910213243546
status: test
description: |
    Detects when secret scanning is disabled on a repository, which also disables
    validity checks for detected secrets. Validity checks verify whether exposed
    secrets are still active, enabling prioritized remediation.
    This corresponds to HTH GitHub control hth-github-2.04-enable-secret-scanning-validity-checks (section 2.4, L2).
