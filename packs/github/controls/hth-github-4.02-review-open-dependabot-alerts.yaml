description: >
  Regularly review and remediate open Dependabot security alerts across the organization.
  Open alerts represent known vulnerabilities in dependencies that adversaries can exploit.
  Critical and high severity alerts should be addressed within defined SLA windows to
  minimize the attack surface.

remediate:
  note: >
    Open Dependabot alerts cannot be auto-remediated via API — each alert requires
    human review to determine the correct remediation (upgrade, patch, or dismiss with
    justification). Use 'gh api /orgs/{org}/dependabot/alerts?state=open&severity=critical'
    to list critical alerts requiring immediate attention.
