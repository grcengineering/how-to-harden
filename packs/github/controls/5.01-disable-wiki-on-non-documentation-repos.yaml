description: >
  Disable the wiki feature on repositories that do not actively use it. GitHub wikis
  are often overlooked in security reviews and can be edited by anyone with write access.
  Unused wikis increase the attack surface — adversaries can use them to host phishing
  content, social engineering lures, or watering hole attacks using the organization's
  trusted domain.
