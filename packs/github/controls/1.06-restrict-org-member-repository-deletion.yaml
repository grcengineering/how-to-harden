description: >
  Restrict the ability for non-admin organization members to delete or transfer
  repositories. By default, members with admin access to a repository can delete it.
  In a hardened configuration, only organization owners should be able to delete
  repositories to prevent accidental or malicious data loss. This is enforced via
  the organization's member privileges settings.
