description: >
  Enable validity checks for secret scanning alerts. When enabled, GitHub contacts
  the partner provider to check whether a detected secret is still active. This
  reduces noise from rotated or revoked credentials and helps prioritize remediation
  on secrets that are actually exploitable. Only available for certain partner patterns.
