description: >
  Ensure a CODEOWNERS file exists in the repository to automatically assign
  reviewers based on file paths. CODEOWNERS enforces that changes to security-critical
  files (CI/CD workflows, infrastructure configs, authentication code) must be
  reviewed by designated owners. Without CODEOWNERS, any team member with write
  access can approve their own changes to sensitive areas.
