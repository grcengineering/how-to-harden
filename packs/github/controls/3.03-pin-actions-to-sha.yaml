description: >
  Require that all GitHub Actions references use SHA pinning instead of mutable tags.
  Actions referenced by tag (e.g., @v1) can be silently replaced with malicious code
  if the action maintainer's account is compromised — a proven supply chain attack
  technique. SHA-pinned references (e.g., @abc123...) are immutable and tamper-proof.
