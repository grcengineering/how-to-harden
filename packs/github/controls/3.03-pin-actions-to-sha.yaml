description: >
  Require that all GitHub Actions references use SHA pinning instead of mutable tags.
  Actions referenced by tag (e.g., @v1) can be silently replaced with malicious code
  if the action maintainer's account is compromised — a proven supply chain attack
  technique. SHA-pinned references (e.g., @abc123...) are immutable and tamper-proof.

  note: >
    SHA pinning cannot be fully automated via API. The sha_pinning_required setting
    prevents new workflows from using mutable tags, but existing workflows must be
    manually updated to replace tag references with full commit SHAs. Use tools like
    'pin-github-action' (npx pin-github-action .github/workflows/*.yml) to convert.
