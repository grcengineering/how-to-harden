description: >
  Audit outside collaborators across the organization. Outside collaborators are
  non-members who have been granted access to specific repositories. These accounts
  bypass organization-level security policies like required 2FA and may not follow
  the organization's security standards. Regularly review outside collaborators to
  ensure access is still required and appropriately scoped.
