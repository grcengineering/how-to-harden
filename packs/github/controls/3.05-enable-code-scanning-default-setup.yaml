description: >
  Enable GitHub code scanning with CodeQL default setup on repositories. CodeQL
  performs semantic analysis of source code to find security vulnerabilities such
  as SQL injection, XSS, path traversal, and insecure deserialization. The default
  setup automatically configures CodeQL for the repository's detected languages
  without requiring a workflow file.
