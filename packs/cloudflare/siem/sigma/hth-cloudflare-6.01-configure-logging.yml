id: cf-zt-6001-logpush-disabled
status: test
description: |
    Detects when a Cloudflare Logpush job is disabled or deleted. Disabling
    log forwarding creates blind spots in security monitoring and can indicate
    an attacker attempting to cover their tracks.
    This corresponds to HTH Cloudflare control 6.1 (section 6.1, L1).
