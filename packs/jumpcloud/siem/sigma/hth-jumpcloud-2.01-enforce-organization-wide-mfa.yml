title: JumpCloud MFA Settings Modified
id: jc-mfa-2001-mfa-settings-changed
status: test
description: |
    Detects when JumpCloud organization MFA settings are modified,
    including user MFA requirements, admin MFA, or conditional
    access policies affecting MFA. Weakening MFA exposes accounts
    to credential-based attacks.
    This corresponds to HTH JumpCloud control 2.1 (section 2.1, L1).
