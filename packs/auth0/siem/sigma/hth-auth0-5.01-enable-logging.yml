title: Auth0 Log Stream Deleted or Paused
id: a0-log-5001-stream-disabled
status: test
description: |
    Detects when an Auth0 log stream is deleted or paused. Disabling log
    streaming creates blind spots in security monitoring and may indicate
    an attacker attempting to cover their tracks.
    This corresponds to HTH Auth0 control 5.1 (section 5.1, L1).
