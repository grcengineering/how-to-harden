title: Auth0 MFA Policy Changed from All-Applications
id: a0-mfa-2002-mfa-policy-weakened
status: test
description: |
    Detects when the Auth0 MFA policy is changed from 'all-applications' to
    a weaker setting. Reducing MFA enforcement exposes user accounts to
    credential-based attacks.
    This corresponds to HTH Auth0 control 2.2 (section 2.2, L1).
