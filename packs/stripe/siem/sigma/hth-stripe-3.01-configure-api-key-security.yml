title: Stripe Account Configuration Changed
id: stripe-account-3001-config-changed
status: test
description: |
    Detects account.updated webhook events from Stripe indicating
    changes to account configuration. This may include security
    settings, team changes, or API key modifications. Since Stripe
    has no granular API key audit events, account.updated is the
    closest signal for configuration changes.
    This corresponds to HTH Stripe control 3.1 (section 3.1, L1).
