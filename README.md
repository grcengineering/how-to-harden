## The Problem

**Third-party risk management in InfoSec is fundamentally broken.**

In August 2025, the **Salesloft/Drift supply chain attack** compromised 700+ organizations including Cloudflare, Palo Alto Networks, and Zscaler. Three months later, **Gainsight** was breached the same way, affecting 200+ more organizations including F5, GitLab, and CrowdStrike.

Victims had conducted vendor security assessments. They had reviewed SOC 2 reports. They still got breached.

**What worked?** Organizations like **Okta** that had configured **their own Salesforce instances** to restrict API access via IP allowlisting. When attackers used stolen OAuth tokens, Okta's requests were blocked because they originated from IPs Okta hadn't allowlisted.

This is defense-in-depth done right: **First-party controls you configure** to limit damage **when third-party vendors get compromised**.

---

## What We Provide

### 1. Platform-Specific Hardening Guides
Like CIS Benchmarks, but free, vendor-neutral, and focused on integration controls.

- Salesforce, Microsoft 365, GitHub, Google Workspace, Slack, Okta, and more
- Covers authentication, authorization, API security, data protection
- Both **ClickOps** (GUI) and **Code** (IaC/API) implementations

### 2. Integration-Focused Controls (Our Unique Value)
Within each vendor guide, we emphasize **how to configure that platform to restrict third-party integrations**.

Example: [Salesforce Hardening Guide](content/salesforce/salesforce%20hardening%20guide.md) includes controls for IP-allowlisting Gainsight, Drift, and HubSpot.

This integration security focus doesn't exist in CIS Benchmarks or vendor documentation.

### 3. Supply Chain Incident Case Studies
Real-world attacks (Drift, Gainsight, CircleCI, Okta) mapped to specific preventive controls that would have blocked or limited the attack.

---

## Quick Start

### For Security Practitioners

**Scenario 1: You use Salesforce + Gainsight**
```bash
# Option 1: Manual hardening (ClickOps)
1. Read: content/salesforce/salesforce hardening guide.md
2. Navigate to Section 2.1.1: "IP Allowlisting: Restricting Gainsight"
3. Follow GUI steps to configure IP allowlisting in Salesforce
4. Estimated time: 10 minutes

# Option 2: Automated hardening (Code)
git clone https://github.com/yourproject/how-to-harden
cd how-to-harden/automation/scripts/salesforce
python configure-gainsight-ips.py --apply
```

**Scenario 2: Audit your current SaaS stack**
```bash
# Coming soon: Stack analyzer
how-to-harden analyze --stack salesforce,gainsight,slack,github
# Outputs prioritized hardening recommendations for your specific stack
```

### For Contributors

```

**Structure Notes:**
- Each vendor/product has ONE comprehensive hardening guide (like CIS Benchmarks)
- Guides organized by control categories (Auth, Network, OAuth, Data, Monitoring)
- Integration security controls (e.g., IP allowlisting specific vendors) are sections within guides

## Why This Project Exists

Existing resources are excellent for their domains, but leave critical gaps:

| Resource | Strength | Gap |
|----------|----------|-----|
| **CIS Benchmarks** | Infrastructure hardening (AWS, Azure, Kubernetes) | SaaS platforms; third-party integration controls |
| **howtorotate.com** | Secret rotation procedures | Proactive hardening (not post-breach remediation) |
| **Vendor documentation** | Feature details | Security-first guidance; vendor-neutral |
| **OWASP** | Application security | SaaS-specific configurations |

**We focus on the intersection nobody else covers:** SaaS integration security, OAuth governance, and supply chain attack prevention through first-party controls.

See [PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md) for full vision and scope definition.

## Principles

### 1. Integration-Focused Over Platform-Only
We emphasize how to configure platforms to restrict third-party integrations, not just platform hardening in isolation.

**Typical guide:** "Enable Salesforce IP allowlisting" (what, but not when or for whom)
**Our approach:** "Restrict Gainsight's Salesforce access via IP allowlisting" (specific integration context, attack relevance)

### 2. Attack-Informed Over Compliance-Driven
We prioritize controls based on **real attack patterns**, not just audit requirements.

Compliance mappings (SOC 2, NIST 800-53, etc.) are included, but recommendations are ordered by:
1. Recent supply chain attacks
2. Common attack patterns
3. Blast radius reduction

### 3. Accessible to All Maturity Levels
Every control includes:
- **ClickOps** (GUI/console) for IT admins without automation expertise
- **Code** (CLI/API/IaC) for security engineers who need repeatability

### 4. Vendor-Neutral But Vendor-Informed
We maintain independence while accurately representing platform capabilities. We don't require vendor approval for content, but we welcome vendor engineer contributions.

## FAQ

**Q: How is this different from CIS Benchmarks?**
A: CIS focuses on infrastructure (AWS, Azure, Kubernetes). We focus on SaaS platforms and cross-platform integration security. CIS also requires paid membership for automation-friendly formats; we're free and open source.

**Q: I found outdated information. How do I report it?**
A: Open an issue with tag `content-outdated` and include the guide URL, what's wrong, and corrected information (with vendor documentation link).

**Q: Can I contribute a guide for a platform not yet covered?**
A: Yes! Check [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for platform selection criteria and use our [recommendation template](templates/recommendation-template.md).

**Q: My company wants to sponsor this project. How?**
A: Email [maintainer contact] to discuss. We're exploring foundation affiliation (OWASP, CSA, Linux Foundation) for transparent governance.

**Q: Do you provide professional services to implement these controls?**
A: No, this is a community project. Some contributors may offer consulting independently—check their GitHub profiles.
